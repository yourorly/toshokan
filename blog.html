                  This absolutely beautiful piece of fiction, titled “The Apothecary Diaries” written by Natsu Hyuuga and illustrated by Touko Shino, is a drama, <br>
                  romance and mystery manga. It also has both a light novel and ongoing anime for those who want to check it out on different mediums. <br>
                  <br>
                  Apothecary Diaries is special in the way that it is incredibly well written; It’s story is quickly paced and highly addictive, and we can’t put it down even <br>
                  until now! The protagonist, Mao Mao, probably will go down as one of the best female characters ever written. She is an active lead who advances the plot, and <br>
                  even while she is targeted by outside forces, she manages to hold her own. The author’s approach by making her a crazy scientist and medical doctor was <br>
                  refreshing to witness, and her obsession with poisons is unique, entertaining and funny, and makes her writing stand out so much. <br>
                  <br>
                  Her boundless curiosity is the source of her strength, but it also acts as her biggest character flaw, and it is again another product of the author’s <br>
                  incredibly writing. Its not often seen in media where a character’s strength also serves as their Achilles’ heel, and have them be so closely connected to one <br>
                  another. It’s so fun to see how much of a cunning person Mao Mao is, and how she also cannot keep her mouth shut. Those aspects really make her character so <br>
                  dynamic and enjoyable! <br>
                  <br>
                  We also love how she serves as the detective for her own cases. The series is incredibly subversive in the fact that it initially offers you cases that seem to <br>
                  be self-contained, Sherlock Holmes-esque mysteries only for the readers to later find out that they are all interconnected with one another. Its such a thrill <br>
                  to read those kinds of stories! <br>
                  <br>
                  The romance between Mao Mao and the male lead Jinshi is so, so good. They have a clear and not forced chemistry with one another. Mao Mao being uninterested at <br>
                  first isn’t played out as the usual “tsundere” trope seen in most Japanese media, because Mao Mao and Jinshi both have dimensions to their characters besides <br>
                  the romance. Jinshi himself is incredibly charismatic and has such an interesting backstory that leaves you wanting to know more. <br>
                  <br>
                  Overall, The Apothecary Diaries has an incredibly story that deserves to be checked out. It can have moments where it falls weak, or the story takes an unecessary <br>
                  step, but those don’t take away from how beautiful, entertaining, and absolutely enjoyable it is.<br>
                  <br>
                  That’s it for today’s episode, dear patrons! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
